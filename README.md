The music-typescript application is developed based on the server-side rendering (SSR) model using Node.js and TypeScript, with Express handling routing and middleware, Mongoose for MongoDB integration, Pug as the template engine to render views directly from the server, and Unidecode for string processing. It also integrates dotenv for environment variable management and includes development tools such as TypeScript, ts-node, nodemon, and @types packages to enhance the developer experience.
